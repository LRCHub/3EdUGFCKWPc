Like a full force gale
I was lifted up again
I was lifted up again by the Lord

No matter where I roam
I will find my way back home
I will always return to the Lord

In the gentle evening breeze
By the whispering shady trees
I will find my sanctuary in the Lord

Oh, I was headed for a fall
And I saw the writing on the wall

Like a full force gale
I was lifted up again
I was lifted up again by the Lord

In the gentle evening breeze
By the whispering shady trees
I will find my sanctuary in the Lord

And no matter where I roam
I will find my way back home
I will always return to the Lord

Like a full force gale
I was lifted up again
I was lifted up again by the Lord

Like a full force gale
I was lifted up again

I was lifted up again by the Lord
