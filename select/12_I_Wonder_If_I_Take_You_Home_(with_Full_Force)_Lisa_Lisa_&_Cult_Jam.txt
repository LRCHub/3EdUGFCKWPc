Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Take me home
Take me home

Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place
'Cause I'm not to sure about how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own place
And I know and you know that if we get together
Emotions will go to work
And I may do something I might regret the next day
And end up hurt

Oh I don't know
That's the way that I feel (way that I feel)
I'm so afraid of a one night deal
I wonder if I take you home would you still make me love baby
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home would you still make me love baby
Because I need you tonight, hah-hoh

Your love is
Take me home
Lately you've been expressing to me
Just how much you want to make love
I want it just as much as you do
But will you still keep in touch
You say I'm teasing but ought to have a reason
Don't let your feelings fade
'Cause you will have me and sooner than you know it
If you could only wait

Oh I don't know
That's the way that I feel (way that I feel)
I'm so afraid of a one night deal, 'cause sometimes
I wonder if I take you home, will you still make me love baby
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if i take you home will you still make me love baby
(Home home, home home)
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home will you still make me love baby
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home will you still make me love baby
(Home home, home home)
Because I need you tonight, hoh-hoh

I wonder, I wonder
I really really wonder (home home, home home)
Take me home
I wonder, I wonder
I really really wonder
Take me home
Your love is

Take me, take me
Take me home
Take me, take me
Take me home
Take me, take me
Take me home
Take me, take me (home home, home home)
Take me home
Uh-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Home
Home
Your down on your knees
Begging me please (hah-hah)

Take me home
Take me home (oh-oh)

Will you still love me (will you still love me)
If I take you home (if I take you home)
